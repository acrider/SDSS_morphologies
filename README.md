# SDSS_morphologies

Currently, this is a self-contained bit of Python code to see if the Conselice functions I've written work. 
You can launch it by running extract_galaxy.py It should produce a galaxy_stamp.fits and then try to fit 
the concentration and the assymmetry to that galaxy.

The RA, DEC, and Petrosian radius have to be hard-coded in (for now).
